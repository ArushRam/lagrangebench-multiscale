### Number of particles
# 100x50=5000 water particles
# 106x274 outer box, i.e. 106x274 - 100x268 = 2244 wall particles
# with only one wall layer, wall particles are 2*(100+270) = 740
# => 7244 particles with SPH and 5740 for dataset

### Number of seeds for a given number of training samples 
# t_end = 12
# dt_coarse = 0.0003*100 = 0.03
# num_samples = 12/0.03 = 400  (+1 for initial state)
# => for 40k train+valid+test samples, we need 40k/400 = 100 seeds
